I have [one set of assignments for you to do before the start of class]({{site.base}}/todo/assignments.html#due_before_class). They're short, and mostly involve downloading and installing some software for next term.

**I will not be requiring that you buy a textbook**. You can download what we need of the book for free, legally. If you wish to purchase the full text, in print, you can get the book details from the website [NAND2Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/), which is the support site for the book and its associated software.
