### Download the Book

The first half of the course textbook, *Elements of Computing Systems* (or *EoCS*, as I often abbreviate it), is available online. Download chapters 1-6; you can download the lecture notes if you wish.

If you want to purchase the text, it is available on Amazon for $25. Personally, I think it is an excellent text, and recommend it highly. So, if you prefer having a paper text, I consider *EoCS* to be an excellent resource.
